WT Project: Read _Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition_ and encode <br/>
~10 algorithms in NumPy, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn. These will be turned
into concept snippets. <br/>
Set up GPU machine and replicate experiments for prototypical networks and 
few shot learning. <br/>
Begin working on the RoastMe project. <br/>
Collect fossil image data with bounding boxes for FossilFinder. <br/>
Perhaps some TensorFlow tutorials. <br/>

__Jackson Wu__ <br/>
Begin working and collecting data for the SignatureClassification project. <br/>

### Spring 2020

__Trevor Martin__ <br/> 
I am taking STAT339 and MATH343, so certainly some private projects will be derived as a result from these courses. <br/>
I really want to explore experimentation with prototypical networks and few shot learning. <br/>
